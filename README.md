# Farm-Easy


Played a pivotal role in developing a cutting-edge smart farming management system, leveraging a React frontend and Spring Boot backend, to optimize agricultural operations and increase crop yields.

Key Responsibilities and Achievements:

**Front-end Development (React):**
Led the design and implementation of the intuitive user interface using React.js, empowering farmers to monitor and control farm activities from any device.
Developed interactive UI components for real-time sensor data visualization, crop monitoring, and task scheduling, enhancing user experience and productivity.

**Back-end Development (Spring Boot):**
Engineered RESTful APIs with Spring Boot to facilitate seamless communication between the frontend and backend, enabling efficient data retrieval and processing.
Implemented robust security features using Spring Security and JWT tokens to protect sensitive farm data and ensure secure access to the application.

**Database Management:**
Designed and optimized the database schema using MySQL to store and manage a wide range of agricultural data, including crop information, weather data, and sensor readings.
Utilized Hibernate ORM with Spring Data JPA to interact with the database, ensuring data consistency, integrity, and performance.

**Testing and Quality Assurance:**

Developed comprehensive test suites, including unit tests and integration tests, to validate the functionality and reliability of both frontend and backend components.
Conducted rigorous testing of sensor data processing algorithms and integration with third-party APIs to ensure accurate and timely data analysis and insights.

**Project Management and Collaboration:**
Collaborated closely with agronomists, agricultural engineers, and stakeholders to understand requirements, prioritize features, and deliver solutions tailored to the needs of modern farming practices.
Adopted agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to manage project timelines, track progress, and adapt to evolving requirements, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and innovation.

**Technologies Used:**
Front-end: React.js, HTML, CSS
Back-end: Spring Boot, Java
Database: MySQL
Infrastructure: AWS (EC2, RDS)
Tools & Others: Git, Docker, Jenkins, JWT
